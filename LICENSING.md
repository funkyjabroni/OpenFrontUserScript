# License for OpenFront.io Project

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive licensing information for the OpenFront.io project, including its evolution from MIT to GPL to AGPL licensing, asset licensing terms, and proprietary content notices.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: MIT Only

- **Commits:** Initial commit through commit before 25d5cc370207fd39e0c3bcaa69873b8fc6c60e68
- **Date Range:** 2024 - March 25, 2025
- **License:** MIT License only
- **Applies to:** Entire project
- **Copyright Holders:** WarFront.io Team, OpenFront LLC (and contributors)
- **Note:** OpenFront.io extensively modified/replaced almost all original code

### Phase 2: Mixed MIT/GPL

- **Starting Commit:** 25d5cc370207fd39e0c3bcaa69873b8fc6c60e68
- **Date:** March 25, 2025
- **Licenses:**
  - GPL v3.0 for `src/client` directory
  - MIT for all other directories
- **Copyright Holders:** OpenFront LLC (and contributors)
- **Note:** Created split licensing structure with copyleft for client code

### Phase 3: AGPL + Creative Commons

- **Starting After:** 9d5c108b83937a30ab42de6b1dca5a64e577aaac
- **Date:** September 4, 2025
- **Licenses:**
  - **Code:** Licensed under AGPL v3.0 (entire codebase)
  - **Assets:** Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 (all non-code assets)
- **Copyright Holders:** OpenFront LLC (and contributors)
- **Changes:**
  - Unified licensing approach (no more directory-specific licenses)
  - Upgraded from GPL v3 to AGPL v3 for stronger network copyleft
  - Added Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 for all assets
  - All new code is AGPL v3.0 only

## Important Notes

### For Code:

- All code prior to September 4, 2025 remains available under its original license (MIT or GPL as applicable from historical commits)
- New code contributions from September 4, 2025 forward are licensed under AGPL v3 only
- Forks and derivative works MUST comply with AGPL v3 terms
- Historical MIT-licensed code remains available under MIT from previous commits

### Legal Considerations:

- The AGPL's network copyleft provisions are stronger than GPL v3
- When combining code, the most restrictive compatible license applies to the combined work
- Consult legal counsel for specific compliance questions
